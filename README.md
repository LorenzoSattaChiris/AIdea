## Brand Identity

AIdeate's brand identity is a blend of modernity and creativity, designed to resonate with a diverse spectrum of innovators and creators. At its heart the AIdeate logo is an artistic conjunction of a brain and a lightbulb, representing the seamless integration of human intellect with the transformative power of AI technology. This symbol is crafted in a minimalist yet dynamic fashion, asserting AIdeate's core mission to make AI accessible and stimulating.

## Market Analysis
Broadly, we identified a convergence in the AI and no-code trends, meaning that it is the perfect opportunity for AIdeate to reach the market.  
![5](https://github.com/LorenzoSattaChiris/AIdeate/assets/150603110/96dc4f93-033f-4a00-bd48-3d38666aa40e)

However, contrasting the trend, there is a small direct presence in the market as shown by our competitors analysis. There are no proper direct competitors and the ones indicated do not share our same focus and purpose.

This allow us to have an important reachable market.

## Business Model Canvas
Our Business Model Canvas serve as the foundation for our future business, identifying our main costs, interactions and revenues. 
![BMC](https://github.com/LorenzoSattaChiris/AIdeate/assets/150603110/88eb3301-0b7d-4d89-a5c2-4d94e147f622)


## Our Product
Our first and main Product is a platform that allows anyone to quickly and easily create a custom neural network AI model. We gently guide the user in the process by explaining each step, allowing for both people new to coding and developers. We then generate a report on the AI performances and propose ways to improve the model. 

### Phase 1 
Phase 1 is our research and validation phase. The objective of this phase is to gather customer informations via organic interactions. This phase will serve as a proof of concept to raise the capital needed to develop the full-fledged product. In this phase, multiple MVPs will be used. All the necessary steps to effectibely perform this phase were executed during this hackathon and are presented below. 

1. An Automated Typeform

To be able to quickly iterate a Typeform will be used, filling for the full app at the first stage. This Typeform contains key question to create an AI from and is fully automated being connected to a Notion database and later our Python Code in order to send the model to the customer. However, the process still needs to be manually reviewed and a human approval is needed to validate the email sending.

![AIdeate - Typeform Demo](https://github.com/LorenzoSattaChiris/AIdeate/assets/150603110/df4ab750-8784-4be9-8b1a-09a9b4d67166)


Notion is automatically updated with all the values collected from the form, and some code running in Notion format those value. I can then easily feed these already formatted dat into my API. The user also automatically received an email confirming the receipt of the data. 
![Typeform Notion](https://github.com/LorenzoSattaChiris/AIdeate/assets/150603110/03b40726-b5f3-46bd-99bb-472a61667c6f)

Try it yourself [here](https://01i18cbtmck.typeform.com/to/fCszoK2g?utm_source=xxxxx&utm_medium=xxxxx). 

2. A Front Facing Website
With a Flask backend (app.js) and HMTL/CSS/Javascript frontend, a simple website that will serve for marketing purposes. For the moment it only displays the typeform. The website will be hosted on Digital Ocean under the available domain aideate.ai. 

4. A minimalist API
A minimalist API to run the models. This API includes the core functionality of the product, meaning generating an AI model from the parameters. It also includes a file to optimize and train the AI. 

5. App Mockups
App Mockups were created in Figma and will be used for market research. The video below illustrates the functionning of the mockups.

### Phase 2
Phase 2 is our product phase. The objective of this phase is to iteratively develop a product to effectively meet the user needs, starting from the existing MVP. Lean Development and constant validations will be key in this phase. 

### Phase 3 
Phase 3 is our growth phase. The objective of this phase is to become an established product delivering an high quality service to customers. Marketing and collaborations will be key in this phase. 


## The Technology
As aready stated on our product section, here are the main technologies used for the project.

## Future Steps
We look beyond the hackathon to a future where our no-code AI platform becomes the standard for intuitive, inclusive AI development. Our roadmap includes an iterative product phase to refine our MVPs based on customer feedback, followed by a growth phase to solidify our market presence through strategic marketing and partnerships. Our commitment to innovation will continue to drive us towards making AI technology accessible to creators and innovators everywhere.
